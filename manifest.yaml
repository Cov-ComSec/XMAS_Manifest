    <p>Our Kings have been trying to use technology to solve a
    problem. Using the latest Python Astronomy, (<code>import * from sky</code>)
    library, they can calculate estimate where the star will end
    up, rather than deal with the problems of following a moving
    object.</p>
    
    <p>Once again they call on their various experts to build a simple
    python web interface</p>

          <p>Balthazar rolls his own again.</p> <p>He looks around to
          see what the Options are and gets inspiration from the
          desert surrounding them, perhaps a sandbox is a good
          idea..</p>
